# Automated Credit Card Analytics Framework

## Overview
A comprehensive, two-phase machine learning pipeline governing the entire credit card life cycle: Pre-Issuance Approval Classification (via Orange Data Mining) and Post-Issuance Fraud Detection Analytics (via custom Python Streamlit architecture).

*(Note: This dataset was explicitly balanced utilizing **Random Under-Sampling** of the legitimate majority class. No synthetic data generation or SMOTE was used, preserving strict transaction authenticity).*

## DATASET PREPROCESSING
* **Scaling Time & Amount:** The code immediately targets the unscaled Time and Amount columns and applies a StandardScaler to compress their mathematical variances without touching the existing PCA columns.
* **Deduplication** The script dynamically scans the entire dataframe and forcefully drops any exactly duplicated rows to prevent overlapping bias.
* **Random Under-Sampling** It creates a clean dataset by isolating the 492 fraud transactions, and then pulling an exactly identical random sample (492 rows) from the Legitimate transactions pool (stripping away hundreds of thousands of excess rows).
* **Final Export** It combines the two isolated frames, shuffles them evenly (frac=1), and saves the perfectly balanced 50/50 dataset directly to creditcard_balanced.csv.


## Phase 1: Visual Fraud Classification (Orange Data Mining)
**Objective**: Interactively evaluate and model fraudulent transactions via explicit visual data pipelines.

### Technical Implementation
* **Core Workspace**: `CC_Credit_Card_Approval.ows` 
* **Execution Environment**: Orange Data Mining Tool
* **Methodology**: 
  - Ingests the normalized anonymized transaction matrices (`V1-V28`, `Amount`) directly from `creditcard_balanced.csv` (which was explicitly generated via **random under-sampling** of the legitimate class, avoiding synthetic SMOTE generation).
  - Utilizes visual data pipeline mechanics to map the transaction topology directly to a binary `Class` target constraint (Fraud vs. Authentic).
  - Implements out-of-the-box classification algorithms (Standard Logistic Regression & Tree Ensembles) visually.
  - Computes native mathematical evaluation procedures (AUC, Classification Accuracy, F1 Scores) exclusively through local widget cross-validation mapping without continuous code debugging.

## Phase 2: Post-Issuance Fraud Detection System
**Objective**: Monitor and classify live post-issuance transactions to algorithmically flag anomalies and actively prevent fiscal loss.

### Technical Implementation
* **Dataset Initialization**: Ingests anonymized transaction matrices (`V1-V28`) and unscaled `Amount` variables loaded strictly via the core `creditcard_balanced.csv` file.
* **Descriptive Framework**: Computes highly memory-optimized `MiniBatchKMeans` algorithms (`k=3`) for instantaneous spatial profiling of standard normative transaction arrays natively.
* **Diagnostic Architecture**: Employs `shap.TreeExplainer` engines to map the marginal Game-Theoretic Shapley values strictly to the XGBoost predictor arrays, programmatically sourcing the exact mathematical feature triggering any anomaly detection.
* **Predictive Machinery**: Dispatches an `XGBClassifier` running a dynamically calibrated `scale_pos_weight` matrix to heavily penalize mathematical False Negatives against rare fraud vectors. Monitors model health via immediate Confusion Mapping and Precision-Recall isolation.
* **Prescriptive Optimization**: Integrates an isolated, bespoke Tabular Q-Learning Reinforcement Agent routing XGBoost probability states mathematically to absolute business actions (`Approve`, `Review`, `Deny`). Extrapolates ideal financial cut-off bounds utilizing epsilon-greedy Bellman equation derivations targeted explicitly at diminishing long-term loss.
